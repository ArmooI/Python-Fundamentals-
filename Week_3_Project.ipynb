    "In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter of some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; \n",
    "\n",
    "the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):\n",
